## 1. Patient Profile Summary
- **Name:** Alex Martinez
- **Age:** 58
- **Sex:** Male
- **Height:** 172 cm
- **Weight:** 86 kg (BMI ≈ 29.1)
- **Comorbidities:**
Obesity: At Risk (BMI in overweight range)
  - Obesity: At Risk (BMI in overweight range)
  - Insulin Usage: Yes (basal-bolus regimen)
  - Smoking: Former smoker (quit 5 years ago)
  - Alcohol: Moderate (2 drinks/week)
  - Vascular Disease: Diagnosed peripheral artery disease

## 2. Image Analysis Overview
- **Left Eye Image:** left_2025-12-24_1430.png
  - Preprocessing: 224×224 RGB normalization, histogram equalization
  - Quality Check: 0.82 (low blur, adequate illumination)
- **Right Eye Image:** right_2025-12-24_1430.png
  - Preprocessing: 224×224 RGB normalization, histogram equalization
  - Quality Check: 0.78 (minor glare, overall usable)

## 3. Model Results
- **Inference Mode:** Batched (two-eye simultaneous)
- **Left Eye Prediction:** Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy
  - Confidence: 0.73
  - Supporting Features: Numerous microaneurysms, presence of dot hemorrhages
- **Right Eye Prediction:** Mild Diabetic Retinopathy
  - Confidence: 0.66
  - Supporting Features: Scattered microaneurysms, early hard exudates
- **Ensemble Diagnosis:** Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy (bilateral)
  - Ensemble Confidence Score: 0.71
  - Inference Runtime: 4.6 seconds

## 4. LLM Narrative Summary
“Alex Martinez presents with bilateral retinal imagery demonstrating characteristic lesions of diabetic retinopathy. The left eye exhibits moderate-grade findings, including frequent microaneurysms and localized hemorrhaging. The right eye shows mild involvement, with early exudate formation but limited neovascular activity. Given the patient’s history of insulin dependency and peripheral artery disease, continued ophthalmologic surveillance is warranted. Recommend scheduling a comprehensive dilated eye exam within 4–6 weeks and reinforcing glycemic control strategies. Consider consultation with an endocrinologist to optimize systemic risk factors.”

## 5. Recommendations
1. **Follow-Up:** Arrange an ophthalmology appointment within 1 month; sooner if vision changes occur.
2. **Systemic Management:** Review blood glucose log with endocrinology; assess need for medication adjustments.
3. **Lifestyle Guidance:** Reinforce smoking abstinence, moderate alcohol intake, and initiate tailored weight management plan.
4. **Emergency Criteria:** Educate patient to seek immediate care for sudden vision loss, floaters, or ocular pain.

## 6. Assessment Prompts & Responses (LLM-Assisted)
- **Prompt 1:** "Estimate the total cost of treatment over the next 12 months and produce a budget spreadsheet with projected monthly expenses."
- **Response:**
  - Estimated annual total: **$8,450** (±15%).
  - Key cost drivers: quarterly ophthalmology visits, anti-VEGF injections (left eye), endocrinology follow-ups, and vision supplements.
  - Spreadsheet export (`treatment_budget_projection.csv`):

- **Prompt 2:** "Estimate recovery turnover metrics and provide a spreadsheet summarizing expected functional recovery milestones and follow-up cadence."
- **Response:**
  - Recovery outlook: gradual visual stabilization expected within **6–8 months** with adherence to treatment.
  - Monitoring cadence: bi-monthly self-assessments, quarterly imaging, semi-annual full evaluations.
  - Spreadsheet export (`recovery_turnover_plan.csv`):

```
Month,Milestone,Expected Outcome,Follow-Up Actions,Notes
1,Baseline stabilization,Maintain vision with minimal progression,Complete blood glucose review,Reinforce medication adherence
2,Symptom tracking,Document vision changes bi-weekly,Schedule telehealth check-in,Use home Amsler grid
3,First imaging review,Assess lesion response to therapy,OCT and fundus photography,Adjust injection schedule if needed
4,Functional assessment,Monitor daily activity impact,Low-vision specialist consult,Consider adaptive aids
6,Midpoint evaluation,Expect measurable reduction in microaneurysms,Full ophthalmology exam,Update systemic management plan
8,Stabilization checkpoint,Confirm plateau in DR progression,Repeat imaging and endocrinology visit,Plan next-year strategy
12,Annual review,Desired sustained control of DR markers,Comprehensive dilated exam,Revise care plan based on progress
