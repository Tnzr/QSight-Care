## 📊 System Architecture
```
User → Streamlit Dashboard → FastAPI → Processing Pipeline → Results
Processing Pipeline: Image Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → ACO Selection → Quantum Processing
```

## 🔑 Key Algorithms
1. **ACO Feature Selection**: Selects 32 most informative features from 512-dimensional CNN outputs
2. **Quantum Neural Network**: 32-qubit variational quantum circuit with angle encoding
3. **Hybrid Training**: Alternates between optimizing quantum parameters and ACO feature selection

## 🎯 Performance Targets
- **Accuracy**: 92-95% (vs 85-90% classical baseline)
- **Inference Time**: <5 seconds per image
- **Quantum Advantage**: 10-15% accuracy improvement
- **Qubit Reduction**: 512 features → 32 selected (94% reduction)

## ⚡ Risk Management
- **Quantum hardware unavailable**: Use simulators with noise models
- **ACO convergence slow**: Reduce ants/iterations, use pre-computed features
- **Live demo fails**: Have pre-recorded video and backup Jupyter notebook

## 🚀 **Implementation Strategy with Sovitrath Dataset**

### **Step 1: Quick Setup (Day 1, First 2 Hours)**
```bash
# 1. Download dataset (5-10 minutes)
kaggle datasets download -d sovitrath/diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered

# 2. Extract (1-2 minutes)
unzip diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered.zip

# 3. Directory structure you get:
diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered/
├── train/
│   ├── 0/          # No DR (1,805 images)
│   ├── 1/          # Mild (370 images)
│   ├── 2/          # Moderate (999 images)
│   ├── 3/          # Severe (193 images)
│   └── 4/          # Proliferative DR (295 images)
└── test/
    └── ...         # For final validation
```

### **Step 2: Data Loading Code (Simple)**
```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def load_sovitrath_dataset(base_path):
    """Load preprocessed 224×224 images"""
    images = []
    labels = []
    
    for class_id in range(5):  # 0 to 4
        class_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'train', str(class_id))
        for img_name in os.listdir(class_path)[:500]:  # Limit for quick testing
            img_path = os.path.join(class_path, img_name)
            img = Image.open(img_path)
            img_array = np.array(img) / 255.0  # Normalize to [0, 1]
            
            images.append(img_array)
            labels.append(class_id)
    
    return np.array(images), np.array(labels)

# Usage
X, y = load_sovitrath_dataset('diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered')
print(f"Loaded {len(X)} images, shape: {X[0].shape}")  # (224, 224, 3)
```

### **Step 3: Quantum-Ready Feature Extraction**
```python
# Since images are already 224×224, we can:
# Option A: Use pre-trained CNN (ResNet18) for feature extraction
# Option B: For quantum, reduce dimensionality further

def prepare_for_quantum(images, target_size=32):
    """Reduce 224×224×3 images to 32 features for quantum processing"""
    # Simple approach: Average pooling + flatten
    # For hackathon, can use this or CNN features
    features = []
    for img in images:
        # Simple feature extraction (can replace with CNN)
        pooled = block_reduce(img, block_size=(7,7,1), func=np.mean)  # 32×32×3
        flattened = pooled.flatten()[:target_size]  # Take first 32 features
        features.append(flattened)
    
    return np.array(features)

# This gives you 32 features per image → 32 qubits for quantum circuit
```

## 🔄 **Alternative Strategy: Hybrid Approach**

### **If you want more data but keep speed:**
```python
# Use Sovitrath for development + APTOS for final validation
# DAY 1-7: Develop with Sovitrath (fast iteration)
# DAY 8-10: Validate with APTOS (more rigorous testing)

development_data = 'sovitrath-224x224'  # Fast, preprocessed
validation_data = 'aptos-2019'          # Standard benchmark
```

## ⚡ **Hackathon Optimization Tips**

### **Data Pipeline Optimization:**
```python
# Use these tricks for faster processing:

# 1. Cache extracted features
import joblib
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Extract features once, save them
features = extract_cnn_features(X)
joblib.dump(features, 'cached_features.pkl')

# 2. Use data generators (don't load all at once)
def data_generator(image_paths, batch_size=32):
    while True:
        batch_paths = np.random.choice(image_paths, batch_size)
        batch_images = []
        for path in batch_paths:
            img = load_and_preprocess(path)  # Your preprocessing
            batch_images.append(img)
        yield np.array(batch_images)

# 3. For quantum, use smaller feature subsets during development
dev_features = features[:500]  # Work with subset first
```

### **Memory Management:**
```python
# Sovitrath dataset advantages:
# 3,500 images × 224×224×3 × 4 bytes = ~2.1 GB in memory
# But you can:

# 1. Work with batches
batch_size = 32  # ~6.4 MB per batch

# 2. Use feature vectors instead of raw images
# After CNN extraction: 512 features × 4 bytes = 2KB per image
# 3,500 images = ~7 MB total (fits in RAM easily)
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FOR HACKATHON: START WITH SOVITRATH**

**Here's your Day 1 plan:**
```
9:00 AM: Download Sovitrath dataset (5-10 min)
9:15 AM: Extract and explore data structure
9:30 AM: Load first 100 images, test preprocessing
10:00 AM: Have data pipeline working
10:30 AM: Start feature extraction
11:00 AM: Begin ACO implementation
```

**This gets you to MODELING by LUNCH on Day 1** - critical for 2-week timeline.

**Contingency:** If Sovitrath has issues, immediately fall back to APTOS but use a subset (first 1000 images) to keep things moving.
